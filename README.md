## Description

CO456 Project Antichess

NOTE: this project is the final project for CO456 at University of Waterloo. Please do not use any code withour proper citation.

Before the start of the game, a command line ```python3 main.py (white/black)``` should be given. If the input is white, our team will play white. If the input is black, our team will play black.

If our team plays white, the AI will generate our move in the format of ```Whites Turn XXX``` in about 13 seconds for the first move and less than a few seconds for following moves. On the other hand, inputs will need to be given for blacks after ```Black Turn``` appreaing on the screen.
